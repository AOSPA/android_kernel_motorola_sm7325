      "message": "and it breaks the brightness slider even more. from 0-50% the screen is dark enough, and 50-80% it gets slightly bright, while 80-100% entirely ramps up the brightness like crazy.. which is worse than the issue that we\u0027re trying to fix here. The only solution i see is either pull in a custom AIDL light hal to device tree and modify it accordingly or merge the brightness curve hacks in frameworks/base.\n\nany other solutions/suggestions are also appreciated",
